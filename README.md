This is a simple disappearing text writing application built with PyQt6. The user can select the total writing time (1-5 min) and the timeout after the last change to the text input was made, as well as enable visual hint when the timeout is near.
An executable Windows file containing the program (created using PyInstaller) can be download at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GJQklRidnoe7zA6JV0RrNIaCIe4cuw81?usp=drive_link.
